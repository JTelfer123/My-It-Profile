<p>
  My name is Joshua William Telfer and I was born on the 19th of July 1999 to my parents Robert and Joanne.
  I am the eldest of four brothers and despite my parents both having brown and black hair, I came out a ginger (lucky).
  I was raised in a typical middle class Australian home, having completed year 12 in 2017 and then moving straight into full time work.
  Going through high school, I loved rowing and found myself joining the school rowing team.
  This led me down a path of being permanently linked to keeping fit and working out, so that’s what I spend most of my time doing besides working and video games.
  I also have a keen interest in learning French and am doing my best to become at least basically proficient in it.
</p>

<h2>Interest in IT</h2>


<p>
  My father is an electronics technician by trade, having worked for Clipsal for a number of years. His keen interest in things like home theatre,
  (at the time) recent video games and building a family computer really piqued my interest at a very young age in all things technology.
  Ever since then I’ve had a keen eye for different systems and computers, which has translated into being able to quickly handle new equipment and technology in my current workplace.
  While I do work in a communication services role, I wanted to be able to undertake tertiary learning and advance my knowledge of IT, which led me to starting this Bachelor at RMIT.
  So far I have completed the Introduction to Programming foundation unit, which may hopefully help out in future assignments for Introduction to IT.
  In my studies I expect to learn things like network management, in depth programming in a few object-oriented languages and how to function as a team on an IT project.

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<h3>
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/51559076?type=promoted#searchRequestToken=476f643b-c52b-40f3-a502-abc53e42cab2">Cyber Security Analyst</a>
</h3>
<img src="IdealJob.png" width=250 height=300 style="float:right;" border: 5px>

  <p>
  The Cyber Security Analyst role is essentially implementing policies and rules to ensure that this particular company is up to date with their cyber security protocols.
  This job is appealing to me because the Analyst must be continuously motivated and required to learn of the newest threats that could occur to the company and constantly learning how new technologies work.
  In my current workplace, I really enjoy learning about new systems whenever the opportunity arises so I hope to implement this same drive in becoming a Cyber Security Analyst.
  In my current workplace, I have to follow certain rules and regulations set out in regards to the operation, maintenance and security of the equipment we use,
  so I can use this experience and apply it within Cyber security.
  <br>
  <br>
  The qualifications needed for this job are at a tertiary level in computer science, IT or engineering with experience in these roles and in cyber security.
  The skills needed for this position include a lot of knowledge and experience using Amazon Web Services, including their security features such as GuardDuty and Web Application Firewall.
  Also the ability to manage and use in the software Docker is ideal.
  The Analyst must also be competent in communicating technically and non-technically with colleagues and even international firms. As I progress in this degree, my technical and non-technical explanations of topics
  will improve as I continue to learn more and more about the realm of IT. To obtain the specific skills and qualifications listed in the job advertisement,
  I will enroll in AWS courses and at the bare minimum achieve the foundational knowledge of a “Cloud Practitioner” and then further develop my AWS qualifications from there.
</p>

<br>
<br>
Another set of skills needed will be to learn how to confidently use Docker containers, this can be done by my own research or by following a pre made course by a company that teaches it.
A good example of this is “A Cloud Guru”,
 which can teach both AWS and Docker at a cost to me. I should take these courses and eventually the AWS exam at any time over the next 4 years while completing my degree.

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>

<p>
  The results of the Meyers-Briggs test don’t shock me and I somewhat agree with its evaluation, but I think that it maybe puts me under “The Logician” because I’m a little bit introverted.
  I believe it depends on the mood I am in and the people I’m around that change how I feel about interacting with people. I can work with other with little to no issues,
  and I purposefully do not try and “pride” myself on a “vigorous intellect” like the Meyers-Briggs test suggests. I do find myself often   second guessing ideas, thoughts and plans a lot, up until the point of indecision, which can be detrimental when trying to actually get myself out of the house.
  The VARK questionnaire also confirmed what I already know, in that I learn the best by reading, writing and gaining experience.
  Creativity has never been a strong point with me, and this test confirms that too ranking myself lower than a typical person.
<br>
<br>
  These results may influence my behavior in a team as it shows that I like to work alone and rely on evidence and facts before I believe or commit to something.
  This would likely make me come off as insensitive if I don’t take into account other people’s views or methods of doing things.
  These results also reinforce things I need to work on, like taking charge and leading, and allowing for more creative input into whatever work is being done.
<br>
<br>
  It also shows that I need to work on my introversion and try and connect with other people rather than just not making an effort to know other people after work is done.
  When forming a team I would need a few people that are similar to me to bounce ideas off and discuss different problems with,
  while also keeping creative and leadership type people around to ensure we have a good amount of variety to make the team work efficiently and effectively.
  Personally, I would need to make a point of being very open to others ideas and perspectives to ensure the team can allow for variety and that they can properly contribute to the team.

<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the world with unprecedented intensity, causing countries to lockdown and has stumped nearly all economic growth, and all worldwide travel.
  To combat the spread of COVID-19, touch-less hand sanitizers have been implemented in many restaurants, shopping centers, sporting arenas, and anywhere there could be a large amount of people closely compacted together.
  My project is a spin-off of the touch-less hand sanitizer, and it adds on a temperature sensor that reads the users temperature from their forehead and displays it on a small LCD screen.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>
  The temperature and hand sanitizer combination will be especially useful within high traffic areas to ensure that people can sanitizer their hands and check their body temperature,
  which is a good indication whether somebody is ill, or displaying symptoms of COVID-19.
  <br>
  <br>
  According to a market analysis report by Grand View Research (), the global hand sanitizer market is growing rapidly, with a predicted compound annual growth rate of 22.6% from 2020 to 2027(). The report doesn’t distinguish between touch-less sanitizer or those in bottles,
  but it shows that even after this pandemic is over, there will be a continual demand for regular hand hygiene.
  Using a combination of temperature sensor and touch-less hand sanitization station through the use of cheap Arduino components will be a an excellent way to mitigate COVID-19 and other illnesses,
  while also screening for potentially sick people.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
  The touch-less hand sanitizer paired with a temperature sensor will allow for the user to sanitize their hands and found out their bodily temperature at the time,
  taking out the man power required to use and record temperature with a typical Infrared Thermometer, as shown in Picture 2.
  The user can then take note of their temperature off the screen and gauge for themselves whether or not they should enter based on their temperature or other symptoms.
  <br>
  <br>
  Another feature the product will have is the ability to record the number of people using the hand sanitizer and also track the temperatures of people using the station.
  This data can be stored to a USB storage device, or in a future development uploaded to a cloud-based storage system, or through to the owner’s phone by Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.
  Another feature that could be added once the basic functionality of the sanitizer is working is to make the LDC screen bigger,
  and have it show the users temperature like before but also list potential COVID hot-spots in the surrounding area and restriction in place in that specific state.
  This way the user of the sanitizer can have an up to date awareness of the current COVID-19 situation.
<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>
  I will be using various plans and designs from Project Hub, which is Arduino’s open source repository of user uploaded plans and designs.
  I will purchase an Arduino UNO board, OLED screen, temperature sensors, certain resistors and capacitors, a pump, an infrared sensor, hand sanitizer, bread board, various colored wires and some kind of fabricated case to hold all the components.
  The software I require would be the Arduino IDE, to input code other users have made and modify based on my project requirements.
  A basic understanding of how the Arduino programming language works will also be required to actually know how to make changes to the code.
  I can learn this through tutorials on the Project Hub website, or through YouTube. I will also need to have parts to make the stand and containers for the sensors.
</p>
<h3>Skills Required</h3>
<p>
  I will need to acquire at least a basic skill in fabricating a stand that will hold the sanitizer and temperature sensor plus its components.
  Learning the basics of computer and electronic circuitry will also be a main learning component for this project, along with the learning of the Arduino programming language.
  There are many Arduino courses out there to enroll in for free, but I believe I can get the same learning experience through YouTube videos and friends who have had experience using Arduino.
  Paul McWhorter has a YouTube series that can take me through the basics of Arduino, and there are many open source projects to learn from too (P. McWhorter, 2019).
</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
The outcome from this project will be a “two-in-one” hand sanitizer and temperature sensor for any business or government building that needs to provide hand sanitization (which is all places)
and show whether people using the hand sanitizer are displaying one of the biggest COVID-19 symptoms,
high temperature. This can help businesses and governments keep a hygienic workplace or store, while also monitoring their staff and customers temperatures, further preventing future COVID-19 outbreaks.
